# OVERVIEWThis repository has Android Programming (from Big Nerd Ranch) book's implemented in Scala. Yes, Scala on Android. My goal was not just to implement this applications in Scala but also to implement them using functional programming style (or at least try).# My development environmentI'm using Scala IDE with the following plugins:* [Google ADT](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html)* [AndroidProguardScala](https://github.com/banshee/AndroidProguardScala/blob/master/README.md)
